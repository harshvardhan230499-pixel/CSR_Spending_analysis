# CSR_Spending_analysis
This project analyzes Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) expenditure in India using data from the 10th Annual Report on the Working &amp; Administration of the Companies Act, 2013 (Year ending 31.03.2024), published by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA), Government of India. The report provides sector-wise and state-wise CSR spending trends over the past five years (2018–19 to 2022–23). I extracted, cleaned, and structured this data using Excel and Python (Pandas), and built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize patterns, trends, and insights.
🔍 Objectives:
Understand CSR spending trends across States/UTs in India.
Explore sector-wise allocation of CSR funds (Education, Health, Rural Development, etc.).
Build a dashboard for decision-makers in CSR & sustainability teams to identify where funds are being directed and how patterns are shifting year by year.
🛠️ Data Preparation: 
The raw tables from the MCA report required cleaning before analysis:
Removed inconsistent formatting, newlines, and extra spaces.
Standardized sector names.
Converted columns into numeric values.
Transformed wide-format tables into tidy long-format data (Year–Amount–Category) for easier analysis.
