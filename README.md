# CSR Expenditure Dashboard (2018–2023) — Harshvardhan Singh Sisodiya

Interactive dashboard and analysis of CSR spending in India (2018–19 to 2022–23), sector-wise & state-wise — built with Python (pandas) and Power BI.

## Why this matters (for CSR / NGOs)
This project helps CSR teams and NGO monitoring teams quickly identify:
- Top sectors (Education, Healthcare) and their share of CSR spending.
- State-level concentration of CSR funds (useful for strategic field placements).
- 5-year spending trend to guide multi-year strategy or CSR funding decisions.

## Key insights (highlights)
- Total CSR (2018–23): ₹126,000+ crores (aggregated).  
- Education & Healthcare together account for ~53% of CSR spend.  
- Overall CSR funding rose ~38.6% from 2018–19 to 2022–23.
